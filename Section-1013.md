This section is in array format and contains building data.

Every element in this array is 812 bytes long.
Many values are shorts (2 byte numbers).
The first element seems to be all 0's or random data, not sure why (currently selected building?).

Some of the data is known, but not all, as some data seems to be spread over other sections as well (section 1049).

If interpreted as all shorts, `unsigned short[323]` is the skin type for hovels.
