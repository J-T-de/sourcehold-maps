# Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to this project, there are multiple ways to do so. Roughly sorted from easy to hard:
- join discussions on the [Sourcehold Discord](https://discord.gg/dzdBuNy)
- reverse data structures
- reverse map sections
- test the online converter
- test and document the python library
- write tools for the python library

Please keep in mind that reversing the map file format is a long term project, and learning things associated to it takes lots of time. If you want to jump quickly into action, probably the easiest starting point is [here](/structure/cheatengine).
