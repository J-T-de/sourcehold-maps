# Section Sizes

This is a comparison of section sizes of .map files on my PC. This is not an exhausive list!

 Some observations:
- some Crusader Extreme sections have two sizes, the smaller one identical to the Crusader size; probably some leftovers from Crusader; similar for Stronghold and Crusader
- some sections seem grow in size for .sav files
- there are no additional sections for .sav and .msv files
