The data in this section seems to be tile data. They look like random 16-bit numbers.

If this section is set to all 0's, the same terrain texture is used over and over.
 
Editing the terrain then also becomes complicated, stopping after several clicks.

When wiped, especially boulder and iron look repetive, but it is also true for some grass, sand and earth.
