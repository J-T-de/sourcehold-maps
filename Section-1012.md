Building unique ID in tile map format.

When wiped and updated, all buildings are gone.
They reappear whenever they are interacted with.
However, Mills wings disappear forever for example. When mill is working, the top section just disappears.

Large lookouttower/watchtowers glitch out when section is wiped.
They also do not respond to the spacebar anymore. Units on towers stand at the base.

Some houses barracks, etcetera, disappear, but only when unpaused and for a short wile (until updated I guess).

flags on buildings disappeared immediately. but reappear.
