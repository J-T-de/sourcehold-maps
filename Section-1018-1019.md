# x_view and y_view
Specifies the viewport of the map in pixels. The point (`x_view` | `y_view`) corresponds to the top left corner of the rendered map with respect to the full map. Coordinate `x` goes from left to right, `y` from top to bottom. With mapsize `400` and `skirmish` one finds the borders

- `x_min = 32`
- `x_max = 5344`
- `y_min = 16`
- `y_max = 2536` 

which makes sense, as there are two tiles at the borders not rendered, which are each `16px` wide and `8px` high.
