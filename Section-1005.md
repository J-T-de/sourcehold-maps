The data in this section seems to be tile data representing terrain height in 16-bit format.
The minimum heights seems to be 0x8, while the maximum height is unknown.
The impact of setting the height to 0x0 is also unknown (why 8 as a minimum?).

Also includes walls!

When wiped, everything is flat. Cannot be repaired, but game happily runs validly. Things are merely drawn at different heights.
