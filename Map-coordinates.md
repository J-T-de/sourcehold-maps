(deduced from section 1003)

The map is shaped in a diamond, and so is the map data when stored.

At least in terms of walls and buildings, the map consists of small squares 19800 in total.

Placing a wall in the top right corner would correspond with coordinate point (0, 0).

There are four sizes of maps: 160x160, 200x200, 300x300, and 400x400.

However, all .map files, regardless of map size, have the same decompressed file size.

Apparently, when a map of 160x160 is used, the same 400x400 coordinate system is used, but only the center of that space is used.
